# NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding

In this project, i developed an interactive dashboard to visualise NTU Researchers. 

In [data acquisition](https://github.com/chingfhen/NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding/tree/main/data%20acquisition), i used a combination of crawling and api calls to acquire my data. The [dashboard](https://github.com/chingfhen/NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding/tree/main/dashboard%20scripts) itself was created using a Python Package, Panel. I also utilized advanced machine learning techniques to in the process to produce more insightful information, which i detail in the [report](https://github.com/chingfhen/NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding/blob/main/Report%20-%20NTU%20Researcher%20Dashboarding.pdf)

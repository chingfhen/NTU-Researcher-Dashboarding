# NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding

In this project, I:
• Constructed interactive dashboards to visualize and analyse the NTU researcher background information in Python
• Performed web crawling, and API calls to collect data, and utilized machine learning to generate additional insight

Additional notes:

In [data acquisition](https://github.com/chingfhen/NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding/tree/main/data%20acquisition), i used a combination of crawling and api calls to acquire my data. The [dashboard](https://github.com/chingfhen/NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding/tree/main/dashboard%20scripts) itself was created using a Python Package, Panel. I also utilized advanced machine learning techniques to in the process to produce more insightful information, which i detail in the [report](https://github.com/chingfhen/NTU-Researcher-Dashboarding/blob/main/Report%20-%20NTU%20Researcher%20Dashboarding.pdf)
